    "This notebook outlines the data preparation process for IBRD Loan Credit Scorecard Predictive Engine Project. We commence by preparing the comprehensive IBRD loan dataset, which we extract from a CSV file. This dataset encompasses various loan-related attributes, including loan status and type, borrower information, and repayment details. Within this notebook, we execute key data cleaning and formatting tasks, alongside comprehensive quality checks, to ensure data suitability for subsequent predictive analysis. The output of this notebook is a clean, well-structured dataset, poised to set a solid foundation for an accurate prediction of credit scorecard using the dataset."
